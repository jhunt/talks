Disaster Recovery Is Just A Surprise Migration
==============================================

**Categories:** data, backups, migration

**Audience:** any / intro


Elevator Pitch
--------------

Backups are boring, unless you use them for more than just saving your bacon
when you drop the wrong database.  Starting from first principles, James
will show you how you can use data protection for migration, test set
constructions, and more!


Description
-----------

Conjecture: data protection (backup + restore) is nothing more than a pipe
in both time and space.  "Backups" are mostly just some ceremony around
piping data you have now to a future-you that needs it!

In this talk, James will take you through his whacky and unconventional
ideas on backups, identify the fundamental units of data protection, and
explore the ramifications for other _backup-adjacent_ activities like data
migration, service upgrades, and data set collation.


Selling Myself
--------------

For the past four years, I've been active in the BOSH and Cloud Foundry
communities.  I'm the architect and principal designer of SHIELD, an Open
Source (MIT) Data Protection solution that I use to provide backup, restore,
and migration capabilities to Fortune 1000 companies throughout the world.

I've given talks at Cloud Foundry summit, and at employer and customer
events.  I've conducted medium-to-large training classes on Cloud Foundry,
data services, data protection, and automation.  I even tell jokes!
